      BASH script to run mc commands.

      The pre-configured host configuration is called 'myminio'. For example,
      if you need to create a bucket, you can write such code:

          mc mb myminio/((bucket_name))

      Support for TLS-enabled minio server is provided with a pre-configured
      config folder that is abailable at '/var/vcap/jobs/mc/config'. There is
      located the custom Certificate Athority certs that the 'mc' should
      trust. So, in a TLS-enabled server, the example bucket creation above
      becomes:

          mc --config-folder /var/vcap/jobs/mc/config mb myminio/((bucket_name))

      Note: we advise you to use the '--ignore-existing' flag to 'mc' when
      writing bucket creation code as above.
